# Toast Notification Component

Toast notifications are used to display a brief alert, warning, or confirmation message or a banner.

## Usage

### Basic usage

```javascript
import * as React from 'react';
import {Toast} from 'baseui/toast';

export default () => <Toast>This is a notification message.</Toast>;
```

### Advanced usage

```javascript
import * as React from 'react';
import {Toast} from 'baseui/toast';

export default () => {
  return (
    <React.Fragment>
      <Toast
        onClose={()=>{console.log('Toast notification was dismissed.')}}
        autoHideDuration={5000}
        overrides={{
          Body: CustomContainer,
        }}
      >
      This a dismissable info notification that is hidden after 5 seconds automatically.
      </Toast>
      <Toast
        closeable={false}
        kind={KIND.positive}
      >
      {({dismiss}) => {
        return (
          <div>
            This is a success notification with an action button
            <button onClick={() => {
              console.log('Action button clicked');
              dismiss();
            }}>
              Take action
            </button>
          </div>
        );
      }}
      </Toast>
    </React.Fragment>
  );
}
```

## Exports

* `toast`
* `ToasterContainer`
* `Toast`
* `StyledRoot`
* `StyledBody`
* `StyledCloseIcon`
* `KIND`
* `PLACEMENT`

## `Toast` API

* `children: React.Node | ({dismiss}) => React.node` - Required
  * Toast notification content. The children-as-function receives a `dissmiss` method that can be called
    to dismiss the notification and can be used as a handler for an action inside the toast content.
* `closeable?: boolean = true`
  * When set to true a close button is displayed and the notification can be dismissed by a user.
* `kind?: KIND[string] = KIND.info`
  * Defines the type of notification.
* `onClose?: () => void = () => {}`
  * A callback function called when a notification is dismissed.
* `onBlur?: (e: Event) => void = () => {}`
  * A callback function called when the notification's Body element gets a `blur` event.
* `onFocus?: (e: Event) => void = () => {}`
  * A callback function called when the notification's Body element gets a `focus` event.
* `onMouseEnter?: (e: Event) => void = () => {}`
  * A callback function called when the notification's Body element gets a `mouseenter` event.
* `onMouseLeave?: (e: Event) => void = () => {}`
  * A callback function called when the notification's Body element gets a `mouseleave` event.
* `overrides?: {Body, CloseIcon} = {}`
  * `Body?: ReactComponent | {props: {}, style: {}, component: ReactComponent}`
  * `CloseIcon?: ReactComponent | {props: {}, style: {}, component: ReactComponent}`
* `autoHideDuration?: number = 0`
  * The number of milliseconds to wait before automatically dismissing a notification. This behavior is
    disabled when the value is set to 0.

## `ToasterContainer` API

* `placement?: PLACEMENT[string] = PLACEMENT.top`
  * Position of a toast notification container relative to the browser window.
* `usePortal?: boolean = true`
  * Defines if the portal is used to append a container to the `body` element. In both cases the container
    is positioned `fixed`.
* `overrides?: {Root, ToastBody, ToastCloseIcon} = {}`
  * `Root?: ReactComponent | {props: {}, style: {}, component: ReactComponent}`
  * `ToastBody?: ReactComponent | {props: {}, style: {}, component: ReactComponent}`
  * `ToastCloseIcon?: ReactComponent | {props: {}, style: {}, component: ReactComponent}`
* `autoHideDuration?: number = 0`
  * The number of milliseconds to wait before automatically dismissing a notification. This behavior is
    disabled when the value is set to 0.

## `toaster` API

* `show: (children: React.Node, props: $Shape<ToastPropsT>): React.Key => {}`
  * Creates a Toast and renders it in the `ToasterContainer`. `toaster.show()` can only be called on the
    client side. `<ToasterContainer />` must be mounted before any `toaster.show()` call.
* `info: (children: React.Node, props: $Shape<ToastPropsT>): ?React.Key => {}`
  * Creates a `KIND.info` type Toast and renders it in the `ToasterContainer`. `toaster.info()` can only be
    called on the client side. `ToasterContainer` must be mounted before any `toaster.info()` call.
* `positive: (children: React.Node, props: $Shape<ToastPropsT>): ?React.Key => {}`
  * Creates a `KIND.positive` type Toast and renders it in the `ToasterContainer`. `toaster.positive()` can
    only be called on the client side. `ToasterContainer` must be mounted before any `toaster.positive()` call.
* `warning: (children: React.Node, props: $Shape<ToastPropsT>): ?React.Key => {}`
  * Creates a `KIND.warning` type Toast and renders it in the `ToasterContainer`. `toaster.warning()` can
    only be called on the client side. `ToasterContainer` must be mounted before any `toaster.warning()` call.
* `negative: (children: React.Node, props: $Shape<ToastPropsT>): ?React.Key => {}`
  * Creates a `KIND.negative` type Toast and renders it in the `ToasterContainer`. `toaster.negative()` can
    only be called on the client side. `ToasterContainer` must be mounted before any `toaster.negative()` call.
* `update: (key: React.Key, props: $Shape<ToastPropsT>): void => {}`
  * Updated an earlier created Toast.
* `clear: (key?: React.Key): void => {}`,
  * Dismissed a specific Toast or clears all rendered toasts if no toast key is passed.

## KIND Constant

* `info` - Generally used for messages with an informational context
* `positive` - Generally used as a confirmation of a successful action or operation
* `warning` - Generally used for messages with an warning context
* `negative` - Generally used as a notification of an error happened as a result of an action or operation

## PLACEMENT Constant

* `topLeft` - defines position of toasts relative to the browser window
* `top` - defines position of toasts relative to the browser window
* `topRight` - defines position of toasts relative to the browser window
* `bottomRight` - defines position of toasts relative to the browser window
* `bottom` - defines position of toasts relative to the browser window
* `bottomLeft` - defines position of toasts relative to the browser window

## Toaster Presentational components props API

These properties are passed to every presentational (styled) component of a Toaster:

`StyledRoot`, `StyledBody`, `StyledCloseIcon`

* `$kind: KIND[string]`
* `$placement: PLACEMENT[string]`
* `$theme: theme`

## Accessibility

* Toast notification container element will have `role="alert"` set on it
* When multiple alerts are displayed and positioned relative to the browser window they won't overlap but displayed in a column way, latest notifications are displayed at the initial position of a chosen placement
* When a notification is set to be dismissed automatically after a provided `autoHideDuration` time hovering or focusing the notification will prevent the notification from disappearing and reset the timeout to the initial `autoHideDuration` value
