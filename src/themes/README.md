# Creating custom themes

Base UI ships by default with the `Light` theme. We understand that in some cases
you want to change the look and feel of the components. To do so, follow the steps
outlined here

## Define your primitives

Primitives are used to define the colors and fonts for the components. An example for
primitives can be found in the [light theme primitives](https://github.com/uber-web/baseui/blob/master/src/themes/light-theme-primitives.js).

## Define any additional theme overrides

Theme overrides are used to change values in the theme like paddings or borders.
To learn more about what you can override, check out the [creator](https://github.com/uber-web/baseui/blob/master/src/themes/creator.js).

## Putting it all together

In practice, you can define your custom theme using this approach:

```js
import createTheme from 'baseui/themes/creator'

import {primitives} from 'baseui/themes/light-theme-primitives';

const yourTheme = createTheme({
  ...primitives,
  // add all the properties here you'd like to override from the light theme primitives
  primaryFontFamily: '"Comic Sans MS", cursive, sans-serif'
}, {
  // add all the theme overrides here - under the hood it uses deep merge
  animation: {
    timing100: '0.50s'
  }
});
```
