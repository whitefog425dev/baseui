## Accessibility

Should support keyboard hotkeys: `tab` - to switch between inputs, arrows, month\year select and day grid. `escape` to close datepicker dropdown.
When month and year selects focused, `up` and `down` should cause dropdown to open and move to value, `enter` and `space` to choose selected year or month.
When day grid is focused, `left`, `down` `right` and `up` to move through the grid days. `Enter` to pick date.
When left or right arrow is in focus, `enter` should cause the same as click on this arrow
