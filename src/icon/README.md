# Icon

See rfcs/icon-component.md for documentation on how to use icons

### Development

The source data for icons should be placed in the svg/ folder.

`icon-template.txt` can be used to change what the React component for icons look like

Run `yarn babel-node ./src/icon/build-icons.js` to build all icons.
