# Contributing to baseui

Do you miss a component? Would you like to extend the featureset of a component?
This document helps you navigate the process.

## Contributing new components

1.  Write a mini-RFC on the component you'd like to add, and send a PR. You can find [examples here](https://github.com/uber-web/baseui/tree/master/rfcs).

* It is ok, if your new component just implements the features you need, we may extend that later

1.  Once your RFC PR is approved, start implementing the component

* To make the review process fast, please try to send small PRs, if you can

1.  Once your implementation is merged, the baseui team will release it

### Definition of done
