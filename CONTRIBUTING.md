# Contributing to baseui

## Getting started

1. Clone the repo locally and run `yarn` to install dependencies from npm.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:uber-web/baseui.git
cd baseui
yarn
```

2. To start a website to develop against, run `yarn storybook`.
3. Each component maintains an `examples.js` file. Edit or add to that file to see changes to the storybook.
4. To unit test your changes run `yarn test` or `yarn test --watch` to continously run the relevant tests.

Do you miss a component? Would you like to extend the featureset of a component?
This document helps you navigate the process.

## Contributing new components

1.  Write a mini-RFC on the component you'd like to add, and send a PR. You can find [an example here](https://github.com/uber-web/baseui/tree/master/src/template-component/README.md).

- It is ok, if your new component just implements the features you need, we may extend that later

2.  Once your RFC PR is approved, start implementing the component

- You can find the component template in `src/template-component`
- To make the review process fast, please try to send small PRs, if you can
- All T0D0s in the code have to have a corresponding issue created. Refer to the created issue in the T0D0s following the format `// TOD0(#44): Something`

3.  Once your implementation is merged, the baseui team will release it

### Definition of done
